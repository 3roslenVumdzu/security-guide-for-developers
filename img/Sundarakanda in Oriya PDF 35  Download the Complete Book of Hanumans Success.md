Sundarakanda is one of the most popular and sacred parts of the Ramayana, the epic poem that narrates the life and adventures of Lord Rama, his wife Sita, and his loyal devotee Hanuman. Sundarakanda describes the heroic deeds of Hanuman, who flies across the ocean to Lanka, the kingdom of the demon king Ravana, to search for Sita, who was abducted by Ravana. Hanuman faces many obstacles and enemies, but he overcomes them all with his courage, intelligence, and devotion. He finds Sita in a grove, gives her Rama's ring as a token of his identity, and assures her of Rama's arrival. He also sets fire to Lanka with his burning tail, after being captured and tortured by Ravana's forces. He returns to Rama with the good news of Sita's location and well-being.
