# P3Dv4 Aerosoft Anchorage Professional: A Review
 
If you are looking for a realistic and immersive scenery of Alaska's largest and busiest airport, you might want to check out P3Dv4 Aerosoft Anchorage Professional. This add-on is a detailed and accurate rendition of Anchorage Ted Stevens International Airport (PANC), as well as Lake Hood Seaplane Base (LHD) and Z41 Landing Strip. It features photo-realistic ground textures, custom buildings and facilities, dynamic lighting, animated traffic, and compatibility with FTX South Alaska. In this article, we will take a closer look at some of the features and highlights of this scenery.
 
## Anchorage Ted Stevens International Airport (PANC)
 
Anchorage Ted Stevens International Airport is the main gateway to Alaska and a hub for Alaska Airlines. It is also an important cargo airport, serving as a stopover for many flights between the USA and Asia. The airport has three runways, two north-south and one east-west, and can handle all types of aircraft, from small bush planes to large jets. The airport has two terminals, one for international and domestic flights, and one for regional flights. It also has a cargo area, a maintenance area, a military base, and a south airpark.

P3Dv4 Aerosoft Anchorage Professional captures all these aspects of the airport with high-quality textures, models, and animations. The ground textures are based on aerial imagery with a resolution of 15cm/pixel, and the buildings and facilities are modeled after real photos and plans. The scenery also includes detailed taxiway and runway signage, night lighting with dynamic lights, functional AFCAD files with realistic approaches, and 3D runway and taxiway lighting that changes according to weather conditions[^1^] [^2^].
 
## Lake Hood Seaplane Base (LHD) and Z41 Landing Strip
 
Right next to PANC, connected by a taxiway that crosses several streets, you can find Lake Hood Seaplane Base (LHD), the world's busiest seaplane base. During summer, up to 800 seaplanes arrive and depart here per day, bringing anglers, backpackers, and other visitors into all regions of Alaska. Many guided tours also start from here. Next to Lake Hood there is a dirt strip (Z41) used by aircraft that have tundra equipment attached (special wheels to enable landing on unpaved strips in the wilderness).
 
P3Dv4 Aerosoft Anchorage Professional recreates these unique features of Lake Hood and Z41 with great attention to detail. The scenery includes a detailed recreation of Lake Hood with lots of static aircraft, custom coastlines and mesh covering the area, animated ground vehicle traffic towards the city with specific US vehicles (pickups, etc.), and autogen adapted to the aerial image[^1^] [^2^]. The scenery also includes Z41 landing strip with its own elevation for a smooth transition from the airport to its surroundings.
 
## Compatibility and Configuration
 
P3Dv4 Aerosoft Anchorage Professional is compatible with FTX South Alaska (compatibility switchable via the config tool). The config tool also allows you to enable or disable features like vehicle traffic and dynamic lighting according to your preferences and system performance[^1^] [^2^]. The scenery is compatible with Prepar3D V4/V5 and requires about 2 GB of disk space.
