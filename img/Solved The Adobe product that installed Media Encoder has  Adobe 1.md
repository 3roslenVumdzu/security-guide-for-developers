# How to Fix Adobe Media Encoder Cs6 Amtlibdll Error
 
Adobe Media Encoder is a software that allows you to encode video and audio files for various formats and platforms. However, some users may encounter an error message when launching or using the program: "The Adobe product that installed Media Encoder has not activated. Please launch and activate that Adobe product before continuing to use Media Encoder". This error may be caused by a missing or corrupted file called amtlib.dll, which is responsible for licensing and activation of Adobe products.

In this article, we will show you how to fix this error by replacing the amtlib.dll file with a working one. This method may work for different versions of Adobe Media Encoder, such as CS4, CS5, CS5.5, and CS6. However, we do not recommend or endorse using cracked or pirated versions of Adobe software, as they may contain malware or viruses that can harm your computer. We also advise you to backup your original amtlib.dll file before replacing it, in case you need to restore it later.
 
## Steps to Fix Adobe Media Encoder Cs6 Amtlibdll Error
 
1. Locate the folder where Adobe Media Encoder is installed on your computer. It is usually in C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Media Encoder CS6.
2. Delete the amtlib.dll file from that folder.
3. Locate the folder where Adobe Premiere Pro is installed on your computer. It is usually in C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Premiere Pro CS6.
4. Copy the amtlib.dll file from that folder and paste it into the Adobe Media Encoder folder.
5. Launch Adobe Media Encoder and check if the error is resolved.

If you use 32-bit versions or versions prior to CS6, you may need to choose different folders for your case. For example, if you use Adobe Media Encoder CS4, you may need to copy the amtlib.dll file from C:\Program Files (x86)\Adobe\Adobe Premiere Pro CS4.
