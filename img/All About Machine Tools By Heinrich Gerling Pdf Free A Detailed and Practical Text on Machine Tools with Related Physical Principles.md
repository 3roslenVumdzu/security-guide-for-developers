Machine tools are devices that shape metal or other materials by cutting, drilling, milling, turning, or grinding. They are essential for manufacturing and engineering industries, as they enable the production of precise and complex parts and products. Machine tools have a long history, dating back to the ancient civilizations of Egypt, China, and Greece. However, the modern development of machine tools began in the 18th century, with the Industrial Revolution and the invention of steam engines, lathes, and milling machines.
 
One of the most comprehensive and authoritative books on machine tools is *All About Machine Tools* by Heinrich Gerling. This book was first published in 1965 by Wiley Eastern in New Delhi[^1^], and has been reprinted several times since then. The book covers all the concepts, machining operations, physical principles, and applications of machine tools, with related and convincing examples in a crystal-clear manner[^2^]. The book is divided into 12 chapters, covering topics such as:

- The cutting tools and their materials
- The cutting fluids and lubricants
- The measurement and inspection of machined parts
- The machining processes such as turning, drilling, milling, shaping, planing, slotting, broaching, grinding, honing, lapping, etc.
- The special machine tools such as gear-cutting machines, thread-cutting machines, boring machines, etc.
- The automation and numerical control of machine tools
- The safety and maintenance of machine tools
- The economics and optimization of machining operations
- The future trends and developments in machine tools

The book is written in a lucid and interesting way, which makes it easy to understand and follow for students, teachers, engineers, technicians, and anyone interested in machine tools[^3^]. The book is also richly illustrated with diagrams, photographs, tables, charts, and formulas that help to explain the concepts and operations clearly. The book also includes exercises and problems at the end of each chapter to test the reader's knowledge and understanding.

Machine tools have a wide range of applications in various industries, such as automotive, aerospace, defense, medical, energy, construction, and metalworking. Machine tools can produce parts that are accurate, durable, and functional, as well as aesthetically pleasing and customized. Some examples of products that are made by machine tools are:

- Engine blocks, pistons, valves, gears, and shafts for cars, trucks, motorcycles, and airplanes
- Turbine blades, compressor disks, nozzles, and casings for jet engines and power plants
- Gun barrels, breeches, bolts, triggers, and sights for firearms and artillery
- Implants, prosthetics, surgical instruments, and diagnostic devices for medical applications
- Pipes, fittings, flanges, valves, and pumps for oil and gas pipelines and refineries
- Structural beams, columns, plates, bolts, and nuts for buildings and bridges
- Cutting tools, dies, molds, jigs, fixtures, and gauges for machining and forming operations
- Jewelry, coins, medals, watches, and musical instruments for decorative and artistic purposes

Machine tools can be classified into two main categories: conventional and non-conventional. Conventional machine tools use mechanical means to remove material from the workpiece by cutting or shearing. They include lathes , milling machines , drilling machines , grinding machines , sawing machines , etc. Non-conventional machine tools use other forms of energy to remove material from the workpiece by melting , vaporizing , eroding , or chemical reaction. They include laser cutting machines , electric discharge machines , ultrasonic machining machines , electrochemical machining machines , etc.
 
Machine tools can be powered from a variety of sources. Human and animal power (via cranks , treadles , treadmills , or treadwheels ) were used in the past, as was water power (via water wheel ); however, following the development of high-pressure steam engines in the mid 19th century , factories increasingly used steam power. Later in the 19th century came electric power (via electric motor ) and compressed air (via pneumatic motor ). Today most machine tools are driven by electric motors or hydraulic motors . Some machine tools also use servo motors or linear motors to achieve high speed and precision.
