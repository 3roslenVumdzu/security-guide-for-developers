# STM32CubeIDE 1.0.2 â 32: A Powerful Development Tool for STM32 Microcontrollers
 
STM32CubeIDE 1.0.2 â 32 is an integrated development environment (IDE) that allows you to create, compile, debug, and deploy applications for STM32 microcontrollers. It is part of the STM32Cube software ecosystem, which provides a comprehensive set of tools and software packages for STM32 development.
 
STM32CubeIDE 1.0.2 â 32 is based on the Eclipse/CDT framework and GCC toolchain, and supports multiple operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS. It also integrates STM32CubeMX, a graphical tool that helps you configure the pinout, clock, peripherals, and middleware of your STM32 device. You can easily generate initialization code and project files for STM32CubeIDE from STM32CubeMX.
