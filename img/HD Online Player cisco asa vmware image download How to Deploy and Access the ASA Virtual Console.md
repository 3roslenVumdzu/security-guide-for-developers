## Step 2: Import Cisco ASAv Image to VMware Workstation
 
The next step is to import the Cisco ASAv image to VMware Workstation. To do this, open VMware Workstation and click on "File" > "Open". Browse to the location where you saved the ASAv image file (.ova) and select it. Click on "Open".
 
You will see a dialog box asking you to name the virtual machine and choose a location to store it. You can use the default name and location or change them as you wish. Click on "Import".
 
VMware Workstation will start importing the ASAv image and creating a new virtual machine. This may take some time depending on your computer speed and network connection. Wait until the process is completed.
 
## Step 3: Configure Cisco ASAv Virtual Machine Settings
 
The next step is to configure the Cisco ASAv virtual machine settings. To do this, select the ASAv virtual machine in VMware Workstation and click on "Edit" > "Virtual Machine Settings".
 
You will see a window showing the hardware settings of the ASAv virtual machine. You can adjust these settings according to your needs and preferences. For example, you can change the amount of memory, CPU cores, network adapters, etc.
 
However, there are some settings that you should not change or remove, such as the hard disk size, SCSI controller type, CD/DVD drive type, etc. These settings are required for ASAv to work properly.
 
One important setting that you need to change is the license file. By default, ASAv uses an evaluation license that expires after 30 days. To use a permanent license, you need to attach the license file (.lic) that you downloaded earlier.
 
To do this, click on "CD/DVD (SATA)" under "Hardware" and select "Use ISO image file" under "Connection". Browse to the location where you saved the license file (.lic) and select it. Click on "OK".
 
## Step 4: Power On Cisco ASAv Virtual Machine
 
The final step is to power on the Cisco ASAv virtual machine and start using it. To do this, select the ASAv virtual machine in VMware Workstation and click on "Power on this virtual machine".
 
You will see a console window showing the boot process of ASAv.
