If you are looking for a powerful drum sampler that can handle any genre of music, you might want to check out Native Instruments Battery 3. This software offers a huge library of sounds, a tag-based browser, and a flexible effects section. However, Battery 3 was discontinued in 2013 and is not supported on Mac OS X 10.10 or higher[^2^].
