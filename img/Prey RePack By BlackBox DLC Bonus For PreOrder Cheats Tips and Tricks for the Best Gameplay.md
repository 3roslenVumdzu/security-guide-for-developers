Prey RePack By BlackBox is a great way to enjoy the game with less disk space and more content. However, if you want to get the full experience of Prey, you might want to check out the official DLCs that are available for the game. These DLCs add new modes, stories, and challenges to the game that will keep you entertained for hours.
 
The first DLC is called Mooncrash, which is a rogue-like mode that puts you in the role of a hacker who must escape from a secret moon base that is overrun by aliens. You have to survive and escape with different characters, each with their own abilities and storylines. The DLC also features a dynamic environment that changes every time you play, making each run unique and unpredictable.
 
The second DLC is called Typhon Hunter, which is a multiplayer mode that pits one human against five mimics. The human has to find and kill the mimics before they kill him or her. The mimics can disguise themselves as any object in the environment, making them hard to spot. The DLC also includes a single-player campaign called TranStar VR, which lets you explore the Talos I station in virtual reality.
 
Both DLCs are included in the Prey: Digital Deluxe Edition, which also comes with the base game and the pre-order bonus. You can buy it from Steam or other online platforms for $39.99 USD. Alternatively, you can buy the DLCs separately for $19.99 USD each.
 
Prey is a game that will challenge your mind and your skills as you fight against an alien threat that can take any form. Whether you play it with the Prey RePack By BlackBox or the official DLCs, you will have a blast with this game.
