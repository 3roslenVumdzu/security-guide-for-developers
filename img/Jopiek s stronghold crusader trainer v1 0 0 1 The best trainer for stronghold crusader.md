The game is set in the Middle East during the Crusades and features historical and fictional characters such as Richard the Lionheart, Saladin, and The Rat. The game allows players to build and manage medieval castles, recruit and command armies, and engage in siege warfare against enemy factions.
 
For those who want to have an easier time playing the game, or just want to have some fun with unlimited resources and troops, there is a cheat tool called JopieK's Stronghold Crusader Trainer. This trainer was created by a group of hackers called CoreHouse Productions in 2002 and was distributed for free on various websites. The trainer enables players to add various resources such as gold, wood, stone, iron, pitch, ale, bread, cheese, meat, fruit, flour, hops, bows, crossbows, spears, pikes, swords, maces, leather armor, metal armor, and wheat by pressing certain keys on the keyboard. The trainer also allows players to select the amount of resources that will be added at each key press. For example, if the player selects 10 and presses G, 500 pieces of gold will be added to their treasury. The trainer also has a feature that lets players disable or enable all other trainer keys by pressing Ctrl+F12.
