Audacity is a free and open source audio editor that can record, edit, and export various audio formats. One of the most popular formats is MP3, which is widely used for streaming and downloading music. However, Audacity does not have a built-in MP3 encoder due to patent issues. Therefore, you need to install a separate encoder called LAME to enable MP3 export with Audacity.

LAME stands for LAME Ain't an MP3 Encoder, which is a humorous name for a software that actually is an MP3 encoder. LAME is one of the best and most widely used MP3 encoders, and it is also free and open source. LAME can produce high quality MP3 files with various bitrates and settings.
 
In this article, we will show you how to install LAME v3.99.3 for Windows, which is the latest version compatible with Audacity 2.1.1 or earlier. If you have Audacity 2.3.2 or later, you don't need to install LAME separately, as it is already included in the Audacity installation package.
 
## Step 1: Download LAME v3.99.3 for Windows
 
The first step is to download the LAME v3.99.3 installer for Windows from the official website[^1^]. You can choose between the 32-bit or 64-bit version depending on your system architecture. The file name should be something like `Lame_v3.99.3_for_Windows.exe`.
 
## Step 2: Run the LAME v3.99.3 Installer
 
The next step is to run the LAME v3.99.3 installer that you downloaded in the previous step. You may need to grant administrator privileges to run the installer. Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the installation process. By default, the installer will create a folder called `Lame for Audacity` in your Program Files directory, and copy the file `lame_enc.dll` into it.
 
## Step 3: Locate the LAME v3.99.3 Library File
 
The final step is to locate the LAME v3.99.3 library file that was installed in the previous step. This file is called `lame_enc.dll`, and it should be in the folder `Lame for Audacity` in your Program Files directory. You can use the Windows Explorer to navigate to this folder, or use the Search function to find it.
 
## Step 4: Configure Audacity to Use LAME v3.99.3
 
Now that you have installed and located LAME v3.99.3, you can configure Audacity to use it for MP3 export. To do this, open Audacity and go to Edit > Preferences > Libraries. Under MP3 Export Library, click on Locate... and browse to the folder where you installed LAME v3.99.3 (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Lame for Audacity\`). Select the file `lame_enc.dll` and click on Open.
 
Audacity will then display a message saying that it has successfully detected LAME v3.99.3 as your MP3 export library[^2^]. Click on OK to close the Preferences window.
