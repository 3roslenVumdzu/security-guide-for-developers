To import your 3D scan data, go to File > Import > Scan Data and select the file you want to import. You can also drag and drop the file into the workspace. Geomagic Design X 2016 will automatically detect the file format and load the scan data into the workspace.
 
## Step 2: Align Your Scan Data
 
The next step is to align your scan data to the coordinate system of Geomagic Design X 2016. This will help you to position and orient your scan data correctly and prepare it for further processing.
 
To align your scan data, go to Tools > Align Scan Data and select one of the alignment methods available. You can use automatic alignment, which will try to find the best alignment based on the shape of your scan data. You can also use manual alignment, which will let you specify reference points or planes on your scan data and match them with the coordinate system. Alternatively, you can use sphere alignment, which will let you align your scan data using spherical markers that are attached to your scanned object.
 
## Step 3: Process Your Scan Data
 
The third step is to process your scan data and improve its quality and accuracy. Geomagic Design X 2016 offers a variety of tools and functions that can help you to clean up, smooth, fill holes, reduce noise, merge, combine, boolean, transform, and edit your scan data.
 
To process your scan data, go to Tools > Process Scan Data and select the tool or function you want to use. You can also access some of the tools from the toolbar or the right-click menu. For example, you can use the Erase tool to remove unwanted parts of your scan data, such as background or noise. You can use the Smooth tool to reduce sharp edges or spikes on your scan data. You can use the Fill Holes tool to close gaps or holes on your scan data. You can use the Merge tool to combine multiple scan data sets into one. You can use the Boolean tool to perform boolean operations on your scan data, such as union, intersection, or difference. You can use the Transform tool to move, rotate, scale, or mirror your scan data.
 
## Step 4: Extract CAD Features from Your Scan Data
 
The fourth step is to extract CAD features from your scan data and create a parametric CAD model. Geomagic Design X 2016 allows you to extract various types of features from your scan data, such as planes, cylinders, cones, spheres, tori, extrusions, revolutions, lofts, sweeps, blends, fillets, chamfers, holes, patterns, and more.
 
To extract CAD features from your scan data, go to Tools > Extract CAD Features and select the feature type you want to extract. You can also access some of the features from the toolbar or the right-click menu. For example, you can use the Plane tool to extract planar faces from your scan data. You can use the Cylinder tool to extract cylindrical faces from your scan data. You can use the Extrusion tool to extract extruded profiles from your
