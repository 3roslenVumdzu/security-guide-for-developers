The film faced legal challenges and protests from Maitreyi Devi, the real-life inspiration for Gayatri, who wrote her own version of the story Na Hanyate (That Which Does Not Die) in 1974. She accused Eliade of distorting their relationship and insulting Hinduism[^1^].

The Bengali Night 1988 subtitrare romana is a keyword that might interest you if you are a fan of Hugh Grant, Mircea Eliade, Indian cinema or romantic dramas. The film is a powerful and poignant adaptation of a controversial and autobiographical novel that reveals a hidden chapter of history and literature.
  
The film is divided into three parts: the first part shows Allan's arrival in Calcutta and his introduction to the Sen family; the second part depicts his growing attraction and intimacy with Gayatri; and the third part deals with the aftermath of their affair and its impact on their lives.
  
The film portrays the contrast between the European and Indian cultures, as well as the different perspectives and expectations of Allan and Gayatri. Allan is fascinated by India and its spirituality, but he also sees it as a place of exoticism and adventure. He is naive and idealistic, believing that he can transcend the social and moral boundaries of his time. Gayatri is a rebellious and passionate young woman, who wants to escape the confines of her traditional family and society. She is also intelligent and curious, eager to learn from Allan and his culture. However, she is also aware of the risks and consequences of their relationship, and she suffers from the guilt and shame imposed by her religion and culture.
  
The film does not shy away from showing the eroticism and sensuality of their love, but it also exposes the violence and cruelty that they face from both sides. The film depicts the racism and prejudice of the British colonialists, who treat Allan as a traitor and Gayatri as a whore. The film also shows the hypocrisy and intolerance of the Indian society, which condemns Gayatri as a sinner and Allan as a corruptor. The film also explores the psychological and emotional turmoil that both Allan and Gayatri experience, as they struggle to reconcile their love with their identities and realities.
  
The film is a faithful adaptation of Eliade's novel, which was based on his own experience in India. Eliade was a young scholar who came to India in 1928 to study philosophy and yoga under Dasgupta, a renowned professor at Calcutta University. He stayed with Dasgupta's family for three years, during which he fell in love with his daughter Maitreyi. Their affair ended abruptly when Dasgupta discovered it and expelled Eliade from his house. Eliade left India in 1931, but he never forgot Maitreyi. He wrote his novel in 1933, but he published it only in 1937 in Romania. He changed the names of the characters and added some fictional elements, but he claimed that the novel was a true account of his love story.
