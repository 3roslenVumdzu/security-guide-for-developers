Relectro has a unique audio engine that processes the input signal on a per wave cycle basis, meaning that it can apply different effects to each cycle of the waveform. This allows you to create complex and dynamic sounds that are not possible with conventional effects.
 
Relectro has a wide range of possible effects, such as compression, expansion, filtering, pitch modulation, wave repeat, waveform replacement, and EQ. You can also morph between dry and wet sounds in real-time using any MIDI or host controller, creating smooth transitions and variations.
 
Relectro is designed to be used primarily in industrial, electronic, glitch, experimental, ambient, IDM, noise, dub, and techno genres, but it can also create unique highlights in any kind of experimental and electronic music. It comes with a large number of presets that demonstrate its creative potential, but it also invites you to play with it like a conventional musical instrument and explore its possibilities.
 
If you are looking for a plugin that can transform your drum loops and samples into something completely different and original, you should check out LinPlug Relectro V1.0.3. You can download it from the link below:

Relectro also has a powerful modulation section that enables you to modulate various parameters of the effects using two LFOs, two step sequencers, and a modulation matrix. You can also use pitch and volume tracking to make the modulation more responsive to the input signal. This way, you can create dynamic and rhythmic variations of your drum loops and samples.
 
Relectro has a simple and clear interface that makes it easy to tweak and experiment with the effects. You can also use two control wheels to blend and morph between dry and wet sounds in real-time, creating smooth transitions and variations. Relectro also supports MIDI learn and MIDI program change, so you can control it from your keyboard or controller.
 
Relectro is not a conventional effect plugin, but rather a creative tool for transforming drum loops and samples into something completely different and original. It is not meant to be subtle or smooth, but rather sharp and edgy. It is best suited for genres that require experimental and electronic sounds, such as industrial, glitch, ambient, IDM, noise, dub, and techno. However, it can also be used to add some spice and character to any kind of drum loop or sample.
