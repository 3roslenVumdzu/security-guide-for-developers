Windows 8 Release Preview also introduces some new features and improvements that enhance the user experience and productivity of Windows 8. Some of these features are:

- Sports, Travel, and News apps: These are new Metro-style apps that provide live updates and information on various topics, such as sports scores, travel destinations, and world news. You can customize these apps to suit your preferences and interests, and pin them to your Start screen for easy access.
- Adobe Flash Player integration: Windows 8 Release Preview comes with an integrated version of Adobe Flash Player in Internet Explorer 10 Metro version. This means you can view Flash content on websites without installing any additional software. However, Flash Player is only enabled for a limited number of sites that are compatible with touch and power efficiency.
- Improved multi-monitor support: Windows 8 Release Preview makes it easier to use multiple monitors with Windows 8. You can now have different wallpapers on each monitor, or span a single image across all monitors. You can also have the taskbar show on all monitors, or only on the primary monitor. Additionally, you can have the Start screen or Metro apps open on any monitor you choose, by dragging them from the top or bottom corners of the screen.
- Improved keyboard and mouse navigation: Windows 8 Release Preview improves the keyboard and mouse navigation for Windows 8, especially for Metro apps and the Start screen. You can now use the arrow keys to move between tiles on the Start screen, and press Enter to launch an app. You can also use the mouse scroll wheel to scroll horizontally on the Start screen or in Metro apps. Furthermore, you can right-click on any tile on the Start screen to access a context menu with options such as unpin, uninstall, resize, or turn live tile off.

Windows 8 Release Preview is a great opportunity to test and explore the new features and improvements of Windows 8 before its final release. However, it is not intended for production use, and may have some bugs and issues that could affect your PC's performance and stability. Therefore, you should install it on a spare PC or a virtual machine, and not on your main PC. You should also keep in mind that Windows 8 Release Preview will expire on January 15, 2013, after which you will need to upgrade to the final version of Windows 8 or revert back to your previous operating system.
