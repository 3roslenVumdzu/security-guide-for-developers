# Toontrack Metal Machine EZX: A Review
 
If you are looking for a powerful and versatile drum library for metal production, you might want to check out Toontrack's Metal Machine EZX. This expansion pack for EZdrummer 2 and Superior Drummer 3 features three kits, a large selection of snare drums and cymbals, and five mix-ready presets, all recorded and produced by legendary metal producer Andy Sneap at Henson Recording Studios in Los Angeles, USA.
 
The Metal Machine EZX offers a range of sounds from classic to modern metal, with punchy and aggressive tones that cut through any mix. The drums were sampled by John Tempesta (White Zombie, Testament, Helmet), who delivered a powerful and dynamic performance. The kits include a Tama Star Classic Quilted Sapele Bubinga, a Ludwig Stainless Steel, and a Truth Custom kit, as well as an extra snare, kick and tom option. The cymbals are mostly from Zildjian, with some prototypes and rare models.

The presets are designed to give you instant results, with different levels of processing and ambience. You can also tweak the sounds to your liking using the built-in mixer and effects in EZdrummer 2 or Superior Drummer 3. The Metal Machine EZX also includes a selection of MIDI drum grooves played by John Tempesta, covering various styles and tempos of metal.
 
The Metal Machine EZX is a must-have for any metal or hard rock producer who wants to add some raw and heavy drums to their tracks. It is compatible with both Windows and Mac platforms, and requires EZdrummer 2 or Superior Drummer 3 to run. You can purchase it from Toontrack's website[^2^] or from authorized dealers.

One of the main advantages of the Metal Machine EZX is that it gives you access to the sound and expertise of Andy Sneap, who has worked with some of the biggest names in metal. You can hear his signature production style on albums by Testament, Megadeth, Arch Enemy, Exodus, Killswitch Engage and Devildriver, to name a few[^1^]. The Metal Machine EZX captures the essence of his mixing skills and delivers them in a convenient and easy-to-use format.
 
Another benefit of the Metal Machine EZX is that it comes with a collection of MIDI drum grooves played by John Tempesta, who has an impressive resume of his own. He has drummed for bands such as White Zombie, Testament, Helmet, The Cult and Rob Zombie[^1^]. His playing is tight, powerful and expressive, and covers a wide range of metal styles and tempos. You can use these grooves as inspiration or as building blocks for your own songs.
