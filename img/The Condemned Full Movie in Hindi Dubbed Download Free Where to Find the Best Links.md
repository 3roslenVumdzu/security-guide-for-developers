However, Esri CityEngine is not a cheap software. It costs $4,000 per year for a single-user license[^2^]. If you want to try it out before buying it, you can sign up for a free 21-day trial[^2^], but that may not be enough time to explore all its features and capabilities.
 
Fortunately, there is another way to get Esri CityEngine for free: using BitTorrent. BitTorrent is a peer-to-peer file sharing protocol that lets you download large files from multiple sources at once[^3^]. By using BitTorrent, you can find and download Esri CityEngine from other users who have already downloaded it and are willing to share it with you.
 
However, downloading Esri CityEngine using BitTorrent is not legal or ethical. You are violating the terms of service and the intellectual property rights of Esri, the developer of the software. You may also expose your computer to viruses, malware, or other security risks. Therefore, we do not recommend or endorse this method of obtaining Esri CityEngine. Use it at your own risk and discretion.
