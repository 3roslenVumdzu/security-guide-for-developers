If you own an Opel vehicle with a CD 500 navigation system, you might be wondering how to keep your maps up to date. Updating your maps regularly can help you avoid traffic jams, find new points of interest, and save time and fuel. In this article, we will show you how to order and install the latest map update for your Opel CD 500 navigation system.
 
## Why Update Your Maps?
 
Your Opel CD 500 navigation system uses digital maps stored on a CD-ROM to guide you to your destination. However, the road network is constantly changing, with new roads, junctions, speed limits, and points of interest being added or modified every day. If you rely on outdated maps, you might end up taking longer or less efficient routes, missing important landmarks, or getting lost.

That's why Opel recommends updating your maps at least once a year. By doing so, you can benefit from the following advantages:
 
- Routenoptimierung dank neu hinzugekommener StraÃen und Berichtigungen
- Besser vernetzte Verkehrsinformationen, neue Verkehrsachsen und somit noch bessere Abdeckung durch den Verkehrsinfodienst
- Keine frustrierende Zeitverschwendung, wenn Sie nach einem Ort suchen, den es auf Ihrer Karte noch nicht gibt
- Mitteilung Ã¼ber aktualisierte Sonderziele (POIs)

According to Opel, the latest map update for Europe features 265,000 kilometers of new roads, 186,000 new points of interest, 881,000 speed limits, and more[^2^]. With these fresh data, you can enjoy a more accurate and reliable navigation experience.
